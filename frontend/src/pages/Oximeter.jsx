          Device Overview
        </h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          An oximeter, also known as a pulse oximeter, is a non-invasive device
          that measures the oxygen saturation level (SpO2) of the blood and the
          pulse rate. It is commonly used in medical settings, home health care,
          sports medicine, and aviation. By using light absorption through a
          patient’s fingertip, the oximeter provides an immediate reading of
          oxygen levels, which is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring
          respiratory conditions.

        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          The pulse oximeter was invented in the early 1970s by Takuo Aoyagi, a
          Japanese bioengineer. Aoyagi's work revolutionized non-invasive
          monitoring of blood oxygen levels. The technology quickly gained
          widespread adoption in medical practice due to its critical role in
          monitoring patient health, particularly during anesthesia and in
          intensive care units. Over the years, advancements in electronics and
          sensor technology have made pulse oximeters more accurate, affordable,
          and accessible to a broader range of users, including home healthcare
          and sports enthusiasts.

            <strong>Q: How do I interpret the readings on a pulse oximeter?</strong>
            <br />
            <span>
              A: Normal SpO2 levels typically range from 95% to 100%. Readings
              below 90% may indicate hypoxemia, and you should seek medical
              advice if you consistently get low readings.
